---

## 🎯 Objective

To detect **early-stage heart disease** using Deep Learning algorithms with high accuracy by:
- Preprocessing patient data
- Applying feature engineering
- Training and testing neural networks
- Evaluating model performance

---

## 💡 Motivation

Deep learning enables the identification of disease patterns that may go unnoticed by humans. This tool empowers healthcare providers to:
- Detect risks early
- Make timely interventions
- Improve patient outcomes

---

## 🔍 Significance

- **Real-time disease prediction**
- **High accuracy with minimal manual input**
- **No installation required** – fully executable in Google Colab
- Helpful for cardiologists and remote medical evaluations
