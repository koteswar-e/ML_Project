## 📘 Proposal

Heart-related diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide. This project leverages deep learning algorithms to identify abnormalities from ECG data and predict heart diseases, assisting healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.

Master cardiologists can classify signals into:
- Typical
- AF
- Tachycardia
- Bradycardia
- Arrhythmia
- Other
- Boisterous

## 🎯 Objective

To detect heart disease at an early stage using available attributes from a heart disease dataset.

- Apply preprocessing to remove null/noisy data.
- Visualize and analyze clean data.
- Use Deep Learning algorithms for training and testing (70% train, 30% test).

---

## 💡 Motivation

Develop a Python-based deep learning application that helps detect heart disease in the early stages for timely treatment.

---

## 📈 Significance

- Deep learning improves prediction accuracy.
- Useful in real-world clinical environments.
- Can be executed via Google Colab without local installation.
